default value for Equipment field.

Group Assignment



How to access GitHub Group assignment?


- Form a group of 3-5 students.
- Decide who is your team leader.
- Team leader first accepts Assignment via Github Classroom link.
- Team leader creates group with the name
- Any other team member selects this team when accepting
the assignment link.
- You will get a team repo (the same for each team member).



How to collaborate?

- Team leader should do first:

> git clone <repo>
> git checkout -b develop
> git push origin develop

This way you all will have shared 'develop' branch.

- Next, each team member:

> git clone <repo>
> git checkout -b develop
> git pull origin develop

- After that each team member locally
adds corresponding content to the sections.
And pushes changes to 'develop' branch:

> git add .
> git commit -m "Added XSS examples"
> git push origin develop




How to submit?

- Once your work is done, your team leader
creates one PR in group repo.
- Each team member submits the link to this
PR via Blackboard.
