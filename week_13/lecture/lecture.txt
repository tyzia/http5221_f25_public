Recap about Final Report
How to fix usability issues














Data Analysis

Involves reviewing collected data to identify:

- Patterns
- Pain points
- Insights

Steps include:

Quantitative Analysis – Measuring metrics
(completion rates, time efficiency, and error frequency).


Example

Question:
"Are users regularly able to complete the 'checkout'
task in under 120 seconds?"

We collected the following data
from usability test:

96 sec - Average completion
88 sec - Min completion
104 sec - Max completion
0 - Critical errors observed

Conclusion:
'checkout' task does not require a redesign.

Facts, observed during tests, should support your conclusion.


Question to keep in mind when creating the report

What you did?
Why you did it?
How you did it?
What you have learned?
What should be done?
What data backs up your findings?

Reporting Findings – Summarize action items to improve usability.

- Things to improve
- Things to investigate further

The goal of the report is to point to
problems and propose solutions.

- Keep solutions specific & positive, provide details.
- Present pros & cons.
- Organize your solutions based on severity
- Don't recommend making small changes to a big problem.
- Align with the client's priorities & help to prioritize.
- Use formal language.












How to fix usability issues








Let's see example of a bad User Experience
when they interact with credit card field.

Example: Usability test shows that there are
3.2 average correction attempts for this field.



demo/broken.html


Problems:

1. Generic error message, doesn't provide details.
2. No live validation - user has to remember how
many digits they already filled in.
3. Not clear, are spaces or dashes allowed?
4. If number is valid, I can submit multiple times.
5. No accessibility added.
6. No tracking of user actions.
7. Doesn't show progress state to the user.


Examples:

Type 4111-1111-1111-1111 (with dashes) → error

Type 4111 1111 1111 1111 (with spaces) → error

Type 411111111111111 (15 chars instead of 16) → error

Each time user gets generic "Invalid card number"
and no details or hints.

The user experience:

A user typing naturally (with spaces) hits both
failure conditions instantly.

User had 3 correction attempts already!

This is a bad user experience.


The cause:

cardNumber.length !== 16

Fails if user adds spaces:

"4111 1111 1111 1111".length = 19

Fails if user adds dashes:

"4111-1111-1111-1111".length = 19


isNaN(cardNumber)

Fails if user adds spaces and 16 chars:

isNaN("4111 1111 1111 1") returns true (because spaces)




Solution:

Don't validate what the user types;
Clean user input and validate it.

Strip spaces/dashes first,
then check length and numeric validity.

Format as they type so they never have to
think about it.


Checks:

Paste 4444444444444444
