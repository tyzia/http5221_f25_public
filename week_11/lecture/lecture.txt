Usability testing (Brief)












The Developer's Approach to Usability Testing

Today's Goal:

Learn to plan usability tests
with a developer's mindset - anticipating not
just what's broken, but how to fix it.








Why Usability Testing Matters for Developers

The Reality:

- Majority of online consumers are less
likely to return to a site after a bad experience.

- Fixing an error after development is way more
expensive than during design.

- You will be asked to fix usability
issues in your career



Developer Advantage:

We don't just find problems - we understand
their root cause in the code.
















Brief


In usability testing, a Brief is a document that
outlines the key objectives of the usability testing.

It is a guide to ensure everyone understands the
purpose and expectations of the test.


Brief should consist of the following:

- [09] Executive Summary.
- [01] Scope.
- [02] Questions.
- [03] Participants.
- [04] Methods.
- [05] Metrics.
- [06] Schedule & Location.
- [07] Equipment.
- [08] Scenarios.

[N] - number in the brackets is the suggestion
in which order to create this parts.




1) Scope

What is the scope of the test?

The scope of testing should not be
the whole website or app.

Be specific in what you are testing
and what you are not testing. Explain
why you choose what you choose.



2) Questions

Add questions which you are trying to get answers for:

- Can users find Search button?
- Does dropdown menu work better than breadcrumbs?
- Do users learn the interface in under 3 seconds?

Explain why these questions matter for website owner.


3) Participants

What are the demographics of people you are testing?

- Age, gender, level of education, income.
No need in personal details (name, address, contact details).

Why you have chosen this group of people?

- This group should be the best match for the scope of your testing.




4) Methods

What methods you will use in your test?

- Heuristics (specify which heuristics).
- Discovery (finding problems by observing users perform tasks).
- Benchmark (test how well solutions perform).
- Is your test moderated or not?

-- Moderated - when there is a moderator who tells participants what to do.
-- Not moderated - when participants have a task and should complete it individually.


5) Metrics

- What you will measure.
- How will you measure it?
- What data you will be collecting.
- Why this data is important?
- Are you sure that a metric will help you to answer your question?

Examples of metrics:

- Successful task completion.
How many participants have completed the task?

- Critical Errors.
How many critical errors did participants make?
What are critical errors?
Why they matter for your test?

- Error-free rate.
How many participants completed the task without any errors?

- Time on Task.
How much time did participant spend on task?
Is it long?
Why this matters?

- Happiness from using the feature.
"Is this reservation process was easy to complete"
Strongly Agree - Agree - Neutral - Disagree - Strongly Disagree

- Comments or Recommendations from the participants.


6) Schedule and Location

When you plan to perform the tests?
Where this will happen?
It can be online.



7) Equipment

Which OS, computer or device your participants will be using for testing.



8) Scenarios

- 'Heart' of your test plan.
- A general set of objectives that guides your test participants.
- Each scenario provides a context in order to allow participant to better
understand the activity.
- What are the most important things that every user must be able
 to accomplish on your application?
- Create tasks that address your test goals.




9) Executive Summary

The whole plan summarized in 1-2 paragraphs.
