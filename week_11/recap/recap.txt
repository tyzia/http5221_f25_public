Recap from Week 11
(delivered on Week 12)


Usability Testing Matters.

- Majority of online consumers are not
returning after a bad experience.

- Fixing an error after development is more
expensive than during design.

- You will be asked to fix usability
issues in your career.

In usability testing, a Brief is a document that
outlines the key objectives of the usability testing.

Brief should consist of the following:

- Scope
What you test, what you don't test.

- Questions
Add questions which you are interested in.

- Participants
Specify target group of people who
would be your test participants.

- Methods
Which methods of testing you would use
(Heuristics, Discovery, Benchmark)

- Metrics
What you are measuring (time, clicks, errors).

- Schedule & Location
Where and when you plan to run your tests.

- Equipment
Which equipment you would use.

- Scenarios
Which tasks your participants need to execute.

- Executive Summary
The whole plan summarized in 1-2 paragraphs.
