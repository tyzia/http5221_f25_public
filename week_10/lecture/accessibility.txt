WAI-ARIA

Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications

https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/


Aria attribute is:
A way to supplement regular HTML elements to make them accessible.

With the help of ARIA attributes we can add information for screen readers.









aria-label


By default, a button's accessible name is the content
between the opening & closing tag.
If button text is missing, we need to add aria-label,
which provides name to the element.


Example (no text):

Bad

<button>
    <img src="icon" alt>
</button>


Good

<button aria-label="Close">
  <img src="icon" alt>
</button>

<button aria-label="Close menu"> X </button>

<button aria-label="Collapse"> > </button>
<button aria-label="Expand"> < </button>



Example (there is text):

<button> Close </button>

No aria-label is needed.




demo: toggle.html, toggle.js















What ARIA attributes are available?

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques

- Define roles: button, link, menuitem, etc.
- Define state: hidden, disabled, checked, etc.




Aria roles





Aria role attribute provides information about element's purpose.
It just identifies the role, it doesn't create the role for you.

Use native/semantic HTML elements as much as possible.

For example:

Bad:

<div role="button"> Click me </div>

Good:

<button> Click me </button>


Don't use these roles, use equivalent
semantic elements instead:

- "banner" role -> <header>
- "contentinfo" role -> <footer>
- "form" role -> <form>
- "heading" role -> <h1> ... <h6>
- "main" role -> <main>
- "navigation" role -> <nav>

Why these roles exist then?

For example, if there is library
and it uses non-semantic elements,
then you would add role to such elements
to make them more semantic.









Aria states

Specifies the state of the element.





aria-hidden





Hides content from screen readers.
Does not hide element visually.

Use aria-hidden attribute to
hide content only if it improves
user experience.



Two options for this attribute:

aria-hidden="true"
aria-hidden="false"




Use aria-hidden="true" for:

- Purely decorative content (icons, images)
- Duplicated content (repeated text)
- Collapsed content (menus, modals)



1) Hiding purely decorative content


Example
(hides plus icon from screen readers,
as it is a decoration)

<button>
   <span aria-hidden="true"> + </span>
   <span> Expand </span>
</button>



Example
(hides svg icon from screen readers)

<button>
  <svg aria-hidden="true">...</svg>
  Submit
</button>




Demo: toggle.html


2) Hiding duplicate content.

Usually we have navigation in both
header & footer of a page.

It is a good idea to hide one
of the navigations from screen readers
(ex. in the footer) with aria-hidden="true".

This avoids unnecessary repetition.


Example

<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
    <ul>
      <li> Home </li>
      <li> About </li>
      ...
    </ul>
</nav>

main content ...

<footer>
  <nav aria-hidden="true">
    <ul>
        <li> Home </li>
        <li> About </li>
        ...
    </ul>
  </nav>
</footer>







aria-hidden="true" hides all children of
the element as well.

Example

<body>
  <section aria-hidden="true">
    <p>This paragraph is hidden.</p>
    <button>This button is also hidden</button>
  </section>
</body>





Display: none

No need to add aria-hidden="true" to elements with CSS
display: none. Because these elements are already hidden
visually and from screen readers as well.





When do you think you would need
aria-hidden="false"?












Answer: when restoring the state.












For example, you have an accordion:

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp

By default, all elements in accordion are collapsed.
They are part of the DOM, but should be hidden from screen readers.
They all have aria-hidden="true".

When you click on an element, it is expanded.
You will set its aria-hidden="false" or remove
aria-hidden="true" completely.

Demo: accordion.html, accordion.js
















Links










How to create a link in html?



You answer:

---



---











Answer: <a href="/some-link"> Go </a>







The main issue with links is
when the link text doesn't actually say
what this link is for.





For example,

<a href="path"> Read more </a>

The problem here: read more about what?



A better way to create this link will be:

<a href="path"> Read more about Humber courses </a>

But what if we:

- Want to display only "Read more" label.
- Want to make this link accessible.

Answer: Use aria-label

Example

<a href="path" aria-label="Link to a page to read more
about Humber courses"> Read more </a>









Task:

You are given a short text about Job Opportunities in the company.
Create a link below this text for further reading.
The link should be accessible.

Tab






Imagine you don't have a mouse/touchpad.

- You can't scroll
- You can't click on links

How would you navigate the page?








Answer: using "TAB" key on your keyboard.


When you press the Tab key, the focus moves from
one element to the next, allowing users to interact
with items without mouse.


What are these items?





Clickable items.















Examples of clickable items:

- form fields: <input>, <select>, <label>, etc.
- links: <a>
- buttons: <button>

demo tab_focus.html





tabindex="0"






You can create your own clickable items
using tabindex="0".

If you add a tabindex attribute to an element,
it becomes focusable even if it normally wouldn't be.

Example

<div tabindex="0"> This div is focusable </div>



demo tab_focus.html







tabindex="-1"






You can make default clickable items
not clickable (remove from tabbing) with
tabindex="-1".



Example:

<a href="path" tabindex="-1"> Read more </a>

Here a focusable element - link
was made not focusable.





You can actually do any negative value like:

tabindex="-2"
tabindex="-100"

it will be treated exactly as -1

demo: tab_focus.html







Order of focus




How to change the order of focusable elements?

You control the order with the numbers provided
to tabindex:

tabindex="1"   <- the first to get focus
tabindex="2"   <- the second
...
tabindex="100" <- the 100th

Demo tab_order.html









What do you think will be the order of these links?


<a href="#"> Link 1 </a>
<a href="#" tabindex="2"> Link 2 </a>
<a href="#" tabindex="1"> Link 3 </a>

Your answer:

---


---

Demo: tab_links.html





Other way to remove clickable element
from tabindex - to disable it.

Example:

<button disabled> Can't interact with me </button>

Demo tab_order.html


Some things to remember about tabindex:

- Ensure important interactive elements are reachable by keyboard.
- Make sure users can see where the focus is
(often handled by browser default styling, but it can be customized).








Accessible Form controls










Which form controls do you know?

Your answer:

---


---











The problem with form controls:
when there is no label for a control.

Without a label, user doesn't know what
this form control is for.

Example:

<input type='text'>

What is this input for?

- last name?
- first name?
- postal code?

Hm, we don't know without a label.

Fix: add label to form control.



How to add label?

Your answer:
---


---




Demo: label.html


Change 'for' attribute and demo how
it will affect focusing inside of input field.
















aria-invalid


Used to mark a form control
as invalid or having error
associated with it.


Two options for this attribute:

aria-invalid="true"
aria-invalid="false"


Example:
(control has error)

<label for="email"> Email: </label>
<input id="email" aria-invalid="true">


If there is an error message associated with this field,
we use:

aria-describedby

It can also be used for help text, instructions or hints.



For example:

<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email_field"
 aria-invalid="true"
 aria-describedby="email-error">

<div id="email-error" style="color: red;">
   Please enter a valid email address.
</div>

Demo: invalid.html, invalid.js

Here:

- If user enters an invalid email
- aria-invalid="true" tells the screen reader that
the field is not valid.
- aria-describedby="email-error" links the email input
to the div containing the error message.
- When a screen reader reads the input field,
it will also read the error message.








To recap:

- Add aria-invalid="true" to form controls with errors.
- Add aria-describedby="some-id" to link invalid form control
to error message block or help text.
- Always provide clear and concise error messages.
- Screen reader will read both invalid form control
and error message based on the above aria attributes.










Practice:

Create an input field for username.
This field is invalid.
Create error message associated with this field.

Grouping Form Elements

Form controls that belong together (radio buttons or checkboxes)
should be grouped.

How do we group related form controls?

Your answer:

---

---








<fieldset>

&

<legend>


<fieldset> groups related form elements together.
<legend> provides label for the group.

This creates a more understandable structure for screen readers.


Which form controls are usually grouped?

<input type="radio">
<input type="checkbox">



Example of a fieldset:

<form>
    <fieldset>
        <legend> Preferred Contact Method </legend>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="radio" id="email" name="contact" value="email">

        <label for="phone">Phone:</label>
        <input type="radio" id="phone" name="contact" value="phone">

    </fieldset>
</form>


Here:

- Radio buttons are grouped using <fieldset>.
- <legend> describes the purpose of each group.

Demo: radio_checkbox.html











Voice over





Let's mimic a screen reader.

I will use Voice over function on my Mac.

To turn it on/off:

COMMAND + F5

On Windows you can use Narrator:

CTRL + WIN + ENTER
or
Start Menu -> Search for 'Narrator' ->
Toggle On in Narrator settings

Demo tab_demo.html with Voice over.












Skip to main content

This is an important feature and actually required by
accessibility standard.

A special link that allows users to bypass the navigation menu.
User can jump directly to the main content of the page.

Usually placed at the very top of the page.
Often hidden, not visible to regular users.
Becomes visible if you "tab" into it.

Demo: skip_nav.html

Use devtools and enable focus on the link.











Thank you!
