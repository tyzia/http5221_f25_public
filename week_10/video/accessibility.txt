ARIA attributes

A way to supplement regular HTML elements
to make them accessible.



aria-label

Provides name to the element.

Example

<button (click)="close()"> X </button>

With aria-label:
<button aria-label="Close" (click)="close()"> X </button>

Example

<button (click)="close()"> Close </button>

A button's accessible name is the content
between the opening & closing tag. We don't need
to add aria-label in this case.


Example

<a href="#"> Read more </a>

The problem here: read more about what?

A better way to create this link will be:

<a href="#"> Read more about Humber courses </a>

But what if we:

- Want to display only "Read more" label.
- Want to make this link accessible.

Answer: Use aria-label

Example

<a href="#" aria-label="Link to a page to read more
about Humber courses"> Read more </a>























aria-invalid

Let users know what went wrong
if their input is incorrect.

Can be: true or false

Example
<input name="email_field" aria-invalid="true">

aria-describedby

Use this attribute to connect
an error message associated with the field.

Example

<input name="email_field"
 aria-invalid="true"
 aria-describedby="email-error">

<div id="email-error" style="color: red;">
   Please enter a valid email address.
</div>






















aria-hidden

It hides non-interactive content from screen readers.
It doesn't hide the element visually.
It can be: true or false

Use aria-hidden for:

- Purely decorative content (icons, images)
- Duplicated content (repeated text)
- Collapsed content (menus, modals)

Example

<button>
   <span aria-hidden="true">&#8635;</span>
   <span> Refresh </span>
</button>

Hide purely decorative icon (SVG) from screen readers.

<button>
  <svg aria-hidden="true" width="24" height="24">
    <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10" fill="blue" />
  </svg>
  Submit
</button>

Hiding duplicate content.

The navigation in the footer is hidden from screen readers,
because it is duplicated. This avoids unnecessary repetition.

<header>
  <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main> ... </main>

<footer>
  <nav aria-label="Footer navigation" aria-hidden="true">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</footer>

Display: none

No need to add aria-hidden="true" to elements with CSS
display: none. Because these elements are already hidden
visually and hence hidden from screen readers as well.

Hide content with aria-hidden only if it improves readability.

aria-hidden="true" hides all children of the element as well.


When would you need aria-hidden="false"?

When restoring accessibility state with JS.

For example, you have an accordion:

By default, all elements in accordion are collapsed.
They are part of the DOM, but should be hidden from screen readers.
They all have aria-hidden="true".

When you click on the element in accordion, it is expanded.
You will set its aria-hidden="false".






















aria roles

Provides information about element's purpose.

But, we need to use semantic elements
instead of aria roles.

Bad:

<div role="button"> Click me </div>

Good:

<button> Click me </button>

Don't use these roles:

- role="article" -> use element <article>
- role="heading" -> use element <h1>, <h2>, ..., <h6>
- role="main" -> use element <main>
- role="navigation" -> use element <nav>

Why these roles exist then?

For example, if there is built-in widget/library
and it uses non-semantic elements, then you would add role.























Tab

We use tab key to navigate between focusable
elements on a page without a mouse.

Focusable items:

- form fields: <input>, <select>, <label>, etc.
- links: <a>
- buttons: <button>

tabindex

With tabindex you can do:

- Make non-focusable item to be focusable.
- Make focusable item to be non-focusable.
- Change the tabbing order of items.

tabindex="0"

You can make non-focusable item
to become focusable.

<div tabindex="0"> This div is focusable </div>

tabindex="-1"

You can make default clickable items not clickable!

<a href="#" tabindex="-1"> Read more (not focusable) </a>

We can achieve the same by disabling the element:

<button disabled> Can't interact with me </button>


You control the order with the numbers provided
to tabindex:

tabindex="1"   <- will be the first to get focus
tabindex="2"   <- will be the second
...
tabindex="100" <- will be 100th

Remember:
Important interactive elements should be
reachable by keyboard.


























Skip to main content

This is an important feature and actually required by
accessibility standard.

A special link that allows users to bypass
the navigation menu and "jump" to main content of the page.

Usually placed at the very top of the page.
Often hidden, not visible to regular users.
Becomes visible if you "tab" into it.
